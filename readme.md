Guerrilla.NET Demos
===========

Welcome to DevelopMentor's demos repository for 
[Guerrilla.NET](https://www.develop.com/training-course/guerrilla-net). 

If you are in this course *right now*, **start by selecting your course's branch** and then just click 'Download ZIP' or clone this repo to your system. On the other hand, if you took a course awhile ago and want access to the demos, your course has probably still around in its **dedicated branch**. Use the branches dropdown to find it or just contact me (email address is listed in my github profile).

If you are **not** in one of our courses, enjoy the samples and please consider DevelopMentor for your [.NET Training](http://www.develop.com/training-courses/dotnet)!

Cheers
