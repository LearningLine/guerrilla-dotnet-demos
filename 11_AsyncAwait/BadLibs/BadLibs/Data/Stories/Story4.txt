My dad's advice to me when I was a ^ boy, around ^ years old.

Son, I want you to know what I really think of you. You are ^. When you were first born and I stared into your ^ ^ ^ I knew right then that you would make me ^. It's a big ^ world out there and there will come a time when I wont be here anymore. You must take life's issues ^ steps at a time. Make sure you ^ your homework, be ^ to others, take care of your ^, buy a nice ^ ^ first before ^ a brand new one, obey your ^ and handle peer pressure the ^ way possible. Don't ^, say ^ to ^, don't ^ and drive, find a ^ girl to call your own, be ^ to her and son never give up your ^. Stay true to yourself and go for what you ^. I know you want to become a ^ some day, make me ^ ! I love you son. -Dad

This is the ^ piece of advice I've ever gotten. I hope it helps you too !
