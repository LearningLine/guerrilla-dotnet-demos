Today is Christmas ! I was so ^. I couldn't wait to see what my family got me ! And I wanted to give them the presents that I got for them. For my mother, I bought a ^. For my father, I bought a ^. But my brother and I fight all the time. I bought a ^ for him. He hates those ! I ran to the Christmas tree and I was so ^ at the number of presents. How can it be ? My brother was right behind me. His face was so ^. Suddenly, I saw my father. You've been so ^ this year, that we thought this was fair. We sat down to open the presents. My mother bought me a ^ ^. She is so ^. My dad bought me ^. This made me feel a little bit ^. Finally, it was time to open my brother's present. I felt ^. I thought I could hear something ^ in the box ! I tore off the paper. It was a ^ ! I ^. I looked at my brother. I was so ^. I can't wait until he opens his present.
